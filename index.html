                    <h3>The Equipment You Need</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whether your a profesional with alot of equipment or just rocking a phone to take photos.
                        Don't worry as it doesn't matter. We are here to teach the basics and all you need
                        is something that will take a photo!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Settings</h3>
                    <p>
                        We won't get to focused on settings right away otherwise it will become way too boring.
                        Will try to teach them as we go along. Like how you have to balance 'ISO', 'Aperture' and 'Shutter Speed'
                        to get the desired style of photo. So dont sweat it.

                    <h3>Editing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here comes the fun part. Deciding how to color grade your photos. Think of it as your the artist
                        painting a painting. You dont want to over do it, but not doing it either won't get the results
                        you are looking for. Why edit? Because we shoot in the 'RAW' format which is what the camera sees.
                        But the photos come out in a flat profile for us to manipulate later.

                        The main thing to always remember is to have fun. There's no point doing something if
                        you don't enjoy it. We here at Visual Stories pride ourselves by trying to always
                        keep it interesting. Not only do we just teach photography. After sessions we go hang out grab a coffee
                        or socialise. This let's us have a connection with our students and a better teaching environment.
