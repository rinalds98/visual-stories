                    <p>
                        Whether your a profesional with alot of equipment or just rocking a phone to take photos.
                        Don't worry as it doesn't matter. We are here to teach the basics and all you need
                        is something that will take a photo!

                    <p>
                        We won't get to focused on settings right away otherwise it will become way too boring.
                        Will try to teach them as we go along. Like how you have to balance 'ISO', 'Aperture' and 'Shutter Speed'
                        to get the desired style of photo. So dont sweat it.

                    <p>
                        Deciding how to color grade your photos. Think of it as your the artist
                        painting a painting. Why edit? Because we shoot in the 'RAW' format which is what the camera sees.
                        But the photos come out in a flat profile for us to manipulate later.
