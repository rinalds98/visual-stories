# 2. Scope
- After multiple design choices; a single page layout was chosen to keep the information simple and clear.
- It has been designed with mobile devices in mind so most smartphones and tablets can access and use the website.

# 3. Structure
- The single page website has a sticky nav bar which makes it intuitive and easy to jump between sections quickly.
- For desktop view the logo is on the left and 4 navigation items on the right create a standard website design for ease of navigation.
- For mobile and tablet view the logo has been centered and the navigation items moved just below the logo to keep the design mobile friendly.
- The first section 'master your craft' briefly touches on the different things that the user will be learning.

# 5. Surface
 - ## **Color**
    - The color theme is based on orange and teal design. The images have been picked with the main color being orange and slight hint of teal.
    - The sign up form button and text input border was #e06004 (shade of orange) to reflect a similar orange used in the images.
    - the color scheme used for this website was 'Orange and Teal' which are complimentary colors. They achieve a look that goes well together and contrasts well.

 - ## **Font**
    - The font 'Lato' was used through out the website and was imported from Google Fonts.
 - ## **Favicon**
    - The favicon I opted to use was the first letter of the website name which consiquently is also the logo. I chose the color '#f1db23' (a shade of yellow) to keep the design the same.

Features

- ## **Navigation Bar**
    - since the website takes the form of a single scroll page I decided that I should make the navigation bar sticky. By doing so it makes it easy to navigate more efficienty around the website.
