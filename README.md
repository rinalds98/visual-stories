Features
=

- Navigation bar
    - since the website takes the form of a single scroll page I decided that I should make the navigation bar sticky. By doing so it makes it easy to navigate more efficienty around the website.

## Bugs

- Solved Bugs
    - When I first deployed the website I tested it on a couple of devices. One of them was on a iphone. I quickly realised the 'Avif' file format was not loading correctly on IOS so I decided to switch all images to 'jpg'.

## Validator Testing

- I tested my website on multiple browsers including: Chrome, Firefox and Safari (IOS).
    - I also tested it on multiple devices including: Laptop, Samsung S20 Ultra (Android 12), Iphone 13 Pro Max (IOS 15)

- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Validator.
- CSS
    - No Errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
- Accessibility (Lighthouse)
    - I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accesible by running it through lighthouse in Google Devtools. But I noticed my performance was significantly lower than expected. This was due to images being too large.
